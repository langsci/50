 In his work \citeN{steels:1996b} concepts may be formed with every possible configuration of categories as has been presented in chapter \ref{ch:cm} as well. This method works well, but is very time consuming. Therefore a more simple search system has been proposed. In the Talking Heads for example, the speaker stops searching for solutions when a good word-meaning association has been found \cite{steels:2000}. So, when the speaker found finds a proper WM association it stops the discrimination game, otherwise it continues. The hearer uses a similar scheme. This scheme was also used in \cite{vogt:1998b}, where it has been found that the robots usually conceptualize with sets of size one. 

To filter out invariant properties of a categorization \citeN{steels:1999} uses saliency on the sensory channels as a criterion for category selection. Saliency is calculated by looking at which sensory channels have most salient features. As the distribution in the sensory channel space will show in chapter \ref{ch:cat}, this does not necessary mean that the best categories will be selected. This is because other sensory channels than the one that has feature value 1 might just as well be most salient\footnote{Recall that having a feature value of 1 is the most invariant property of the perception of a segment.}. Therefore the choice has been made to use conjunctions to filter out he invariant properties.

The current implementation uses conjunctions of categories, but suppose the robots have categorized each segment at every hierarchical layer for all sensory channels, the robots may reach a depth of 5 or 6 layers. With 4 sensory channels, there are then $6^4=1296$ possibilities for each segment (when all possible configurations are allowed, there are $7^4=2401$ possibilities). A discrimination game can yield many concept sets. Suppose that one category can do the job, then there are $6^3=216$ possible concepts. When exhaustive search method is used, all these concepts should be used to search the lexicon etc.. Obviously this is computationally inefficient. Therefore, the current implementation only allows concepts at one hierarchical layer. So each segment is conceptualized with at most 6 concepts, each of 4 categories that are active at the same hierarchical layer.
